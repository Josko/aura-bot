# BOT CONFIGURATION #
#####################

### the path to your local Warcraft III directory
###  this path must contain war3.exe, storm.dll, and game.dll
###  if this path contains War3Patch.mpq the bot will attempt to extract "Scripts\common.j" and "Scripts\blizzard.j" on startup and write them to bot_mapcfgpath (which is defined later in this file)
###  common.j and blizzard.j are only required for automatically calculating map_crc, you do not need them if your map config files already contain map_crc

bot_war3path = C:\Program Files\Warcraft III

### the address Aura will bind to when hosting games (leave it blank to bind to all available addresses)
###  if you don't know what this is just leave it blank

bot_bindaddress =

### the port Aura will host games on (this must be different from your bot_reconnectport)

bot_hostport = 6112
	 	
### the port Aura will listen for GProxy++ reliable reconnects on
	 	
bot_reconnectport = 6113
	 	
### the maximum number of minutes to wait for a GProxy++ client to reconnect to the game	
###  if you set this to 0 or 1 Aura will wait for up to 1 minute	 	
###  if you set this to 10 or more Aura will only wait for up to 10 minutes
###  due to the way GProxy++ works, increasing this value increases bandwidth requirements and CPU requirements on the players' computers
###  players can always vote to drop a player who is lagging after waiting 45 seconds regardless of this value
	
bot_reconnectwaittime = 3

### maximum number of games to host at once

bot_maxgames = 20

### command trigger for ingame only (battle.net command triggers are defined later)

bot_commandtrigger = !

### the path to the directory where you keep your map config files
###  this directory can also contain common.j and blizzard.j (extracted from War3Patch.mpq)
###  common.j and blizzard.j are only required for automatically calculating map_crc, you do not need them if your map config files already contain map_crc

bot_mapcfgpath = mapcfgs

### the path to the directory where you keep your map files
###  Aura doesn't require map files but if it has access to them it can send them to players and automatically calculate most map config values
###  Aura will search [bot_mappath + map_localpath] for the map file (map_localpath is set in each map's config file)

bot_mappath = C:\Program Files\Warcraft III\Maps\Download\

### the bot's virtual host name as it appears in the game lobby
###  colour codes are defined by the sequence "|cFF" followed by a six character hexadecimal colour in RRGGBB format (e.g. 0000FF for pure blue)
###  the virtual host name cannot be longer than 15 characters including the colour code, if you try to go over this limit Aura will use the default virtual host name

bot_virtualhostname = |cFF4080C0Aura

### whether to automatically lock games when the owner joins

bot_autolock = 0

### whether to allow map downloads or not
###  set to 0 to disable map downloads
###  set to 1 to enable map downloads
###  set to 2 to enable conditional map downloads (an admin must start each map download with the !download or !dl command)

bot_allowdownloads = 1

### the maximum number of players allowed to download the map at the same time

bot_maxdownloaders = 3

### the maximum combined download speed of all players downloading the map (in KB/sec)

bot_maxdownloadspeed = 100

### use LC style pings (divide actual pings by two)

bot_lcpings = 1

### auto kick players with ping higher than this

bot_autokickping = 400

### automatically close the game lobby if a reserved player (or admin) doesn't join it for this many minutes

bot_lobbytimelimit = 10

### the game latency
###  this can always be changed for a particular game with the !latency command (which enforces a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 500)

bot_latency = 100

### the maximum number of packets a player is allowed to get out of sync by before starting the lag screen
###  this can always be changed for a particular game with the !synclimit command (which enforces a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 10000)

bot_synclimit = 50

### the percentage of players required to vote yes for a votekick to pass
###  the player starting the votekick is assumed to have voted yes and the player the votekick is started against is assumed to have voted no
###  the formula for calculating the number of votes needed is votes_needed = ceil( ( num_players - 1 ) * bot_votekickpercentage / 100 )
###  this means it will round UP the number of votes required
###  if you set it to 100 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9, 9/10, 10/11, and 11/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 90 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9, 9/10, 9/11, and 10/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 80 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/9, 8/10, 8/11, and 9/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 70 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 5/8, 6/9, 7/10, 7/11, and 8/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 60 it will require 2/3, 2/4, 3/5, 3/6, 4/7, 5/8, 5/9, 6/10, 6/11, and 7/12 votes to pass

bot_votekickpercentage = 100

bot_defaultmap = wormwar

# LAN CONFIGURATION #
#####################

### the Warcraft 3 version to use when broadcasting LAN games

lan_war3version = 28

### the UDP broadcast target
###  if this value is blank the bot will try to broadcast LAN games on the default interface which is chosen by your operating system
###  sometimes your operating system will choose the wrong interface when more than one exists
###  therefore you can use this value to force the bot to use a specific interface
###  for example you may set it to 192.168.1.255 to broadcast LAN games to the 192.168.1.x subnet
###  also if you want to broadcast to a connected Hamachi network set it to 5.255.255.255
