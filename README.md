Aura
====

Aura is a Warcraft III hosting-bot based on GHost++ by Varlock. It's a complete
overhaul with speed and efficiency in mind and packed with fewer dependencies.

Multi-platform
--------------

The bot runs on little-endian Linux (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and OS X (64-bit Intel CPU) machines.

Boost
-----

You will need the [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download/) libraries. Specifically
boost date-time, system and filesystem.

### Windows

Windows users can build by:
	
	... cd to the boost directory
	bootstrap

Then, depending on platform, for Win32:

	bjam date_time filesystem system link=static threading=multi variant=release address-model=32

and for x64:

	bjam date_time filesystem system link=static threading=multi variant=release address-model=64
	
Then move the library files from the bin.v2 folder to `~/aura-bot/boost/lib` or `~/aura-bot/boost/lib64`, depnding on
the platform.

### Linux

Linux users can usually fetch them from the repository:

* Arch Linux -- `pacman -S boost`
* Debian/Ubuntu -- `apt-get install libboost-date-time-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev`

### OS X

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is the basic dependency for building anything on OS X.
Apple's development tool is a free download from the MacAppStore or downloadable in Apple's Developer Area (a free membership is sufficient). After you installed Xcode, go to its preferences and install the `Command Line Tools`.
Without Xcode installed you cannot proceed any further and won't be able to build boost.

The easiest way to go for boost is by using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
After a successful install open (or reopen) `Terminal.app` located in `/Applications/Utilities` and execute

	brew install boost
	
Building boost may take some time.

Building
--------

### Windows

Windows users should use VS2010 as there are the necessary .sln and .vcxproj files. Before
building, choose the Win32 or x64 platform. The binary shall be generated in the `..\aura-bot\aura\Release` folder.
Run it from `aura-bot` folder.

### Linux

Linux users will probably need some packages for it to build:

* Debian/Ubuntu -- `apt-get install build-essential m4 libgmp3-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev`
* Arch Linux -- `pacman -S base-devel`

For building StormLib execute the following commands (line by line):	
	
	cd aura-bot/StormLib/stormlib
	make
	sudo make install

Continue building bncsutil:

	cd ../..
	cd bncsutil/src/bncsutil
	make
	sudo make install	
	
Then proceed to build Aura:

	cd ../../..
	cd aura
	make && make install
	cd ..
	
Now you can run Aura by executing `./aura++`.

### OS X

Most likely you'll need a more recent version of libgmp. Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

	brew install gmp
   
When finished type `cd ` (mind the space!) in Terminal, drag&drop your `aura-bot`-folder into the Terminal 
window to get the folder's path and execute with enter.

For building StormLib execute the following commands (line by line):

	cd StormLib/stormlib_osx
	make
	sudo make install
   
Continue building bncsutil:

	cd ../..
	cd bncsutil/src/bncsutil
	make
	sudo make install
   
Go on building aura:

	cd ../../..
	cd aura
	make && make install
	cd ..
   
Now you can run aura by executing `./aura++` in Terminal.

Configuring
-----------

Modify the `aura.cfg` file to configure the bot to your wishes.
